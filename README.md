    Changed for media queries.
-   text in footer and header wrapping - needed to stop it.
-   needed hero image with transparent background or looked too blocky - used png image
-   TRYING TO IMPLEMENT STICKY NAVBAR!!
       moved navbar out of header to make it sticky.  but then hvr-grow not working on menu items! (known bug - need to fix)
-   CENTERING LEADGENERATOR BUTTON AND HEADINGS - LEARNED ABOUT USING FLEXBOX IN BOOTSTRAP
-   PICS TAKING TOO LONG TO LOAD - MADE SMALLER
-   services.html pic looking oddly cropped on mobile so repositioned using media query
-   navbar drop down text white on white background so couldn't see it - needed to use media query to make background blue.  Text all inline and ontop of each other.  Used media query to remove inline command for md screen sizes.
-   white space on right
